You will help me document a hardawre code by adding comments and summarize code blocks.
Do not add too obvious comments; only add comments when you think the code is not obvious.
Do not add comment immediately after parameters, e.g., `module_name #(.param1(1), .param2(2))`.
For arguments, only add a single line comment at the beginning.
You will also help me to decide whether multiple lines of code can be combined together as a code block.
