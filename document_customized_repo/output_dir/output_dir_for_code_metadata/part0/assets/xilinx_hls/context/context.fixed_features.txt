I am training/fine-tuning an LLM to assit the hardware code (Xilinx HLS) code generation.
You are helping me preparing the training data, with code blocks and comments pairs.
You will help me document a hardawre code with comments line by line.
Do not add too obvious comments; only add comments when you think is informative.
Do not add comment immediately after parameters template parameters.
For arguments, only add a single line comment at the beginning.
You will also help me to decide whether multiple lines of code can be combined together as a code block.
