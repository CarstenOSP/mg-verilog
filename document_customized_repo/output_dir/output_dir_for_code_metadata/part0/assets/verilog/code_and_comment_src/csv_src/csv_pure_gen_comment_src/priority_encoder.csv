"Implements a parameterizable priority encoder that provides valid, encoded, and one-hot outputs.",0
Sets the number of encoding stages needed for the given width.,1
Defines the internal power-of-two width used by the encoder.,2
Pads the input to the next power-of-two size for uniform processing.,3
Holds intermediate valid signals across each level of the encoding pipeline.,4
Stores the partial encoding for each level of the pipeline.,5
Generates a block for each 2-bit slice in the first stage.,8
Marks the corresponding slice as valid if any bit is set.,9
Determines priority selection in the first stage based on the LSB_HIGH_PRIORITY parameter.,10
Uses the inverted LSB as the encoded value when LSB has priority.,11
Uses the next bit as the encoded value when the LSB is not prioritized.,13
Begins iteration over subsequent levels of the encoder pipeline.,16
Compresses valid signals from the previous stage in pairs.,17
Aggregates valid bits from the previous level for the current chunk.,18
Conditional section for handling lower significant bit as highest priority.,19
Selects a portion of the previous level's encoded data based on the valid signal and prefixes a bit indicating which half was chosen.,20
"Chooses and prefixes a bit for the else scenario, selecting a portion of the previous encoding based on the valid signal.",22
Generates a one-hot output from the final encoded index.,29
