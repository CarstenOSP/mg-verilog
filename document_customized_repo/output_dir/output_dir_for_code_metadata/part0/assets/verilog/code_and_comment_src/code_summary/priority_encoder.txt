{"usage": "This parameterizable priority encoder can be instantiated in digital designs requiring an index of the first asserted bit. It offers a configurable width and supports both LSB-high and MSB-high priority selection based on the LSB_HIGH_PRIORITY parameter.", "summary": "The module performs a hierarchical priority encoding of the input bits, returning a valid flag, a log2(WIDTH)-bit encoded index, and a one-hot output. It splits the input into pairs, determines which pair has priority, and iteratively refines until one final index is chosen. Depending on the LSB_HIGH_PRIORITY setting, the module either prioritizes the lower or the higher bit in each pair, ensuring flexibility in how the highest-priority set bit is identified."}
