{"usage": "This parameterizable priority encoder is used to detect the highest-priority active bit in a multi-bit input. Users can select LSB or MSB as higher priority. It provides both a binary-encoded index and a one-hot output indicating the position of the active bit.", "summary": "The design pads its input to a power-of-two size, processes it in iterative layers, and merges partial stage results to form a final encoded index and one-hot output. The 'LSB_HIGH_PRIORITY' parameter determines whether the lowest or highest set bit has precedence, and the final stage outputs a valid signal, the binary-encoded position, and a corresponding one-hot signal."}
