{"usage": "Instantiate this module where a priority encoder is needed to detect the first asserted bit in a multibit signal, setting LSB_HIGH_PRIORITY=1 to prioritize lower indices or 0 for higher indices. Outputs include a valid indicator, an integer-encoded index, and a corresponding one-hot representation.", "summary": "This parameterizable priority encoder pads the input to the nearest power of two and processes it in multiple stages, combining pairs of bits at each level to produce an encoded index of the highest-priority active bit. The final stage provides a one-hot output, alongside a valid signal and the integer-encoded index. The LSB_HIGH_PRIORITY parameter toggles the direction of priority."}
