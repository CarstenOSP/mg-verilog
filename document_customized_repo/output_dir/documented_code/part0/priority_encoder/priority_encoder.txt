{"usage": "Instantiate this parameterizable priority encoder when you need to determine a valid index of the highest (or lowest) priority set bit in an input vector. It simultaneously provides a valid flag, a binary-encoded result, and a one-hot representation corresponding to the identified bit. Adjust the WIDTH parameter to match the input size, and use LSB_HIGH_PRIORITY to control whether the least significant bit or the most significant bit has priority.", "summary": "This module extends a simple priority encoder into multiple pipeline levels by padding the input to the nearest power of two and iteratively reducing valid signals while creating partial encodings. The final outputs indicate (1) whether any input bit is set (output_valid), (2) the binary encoding of the set bit (output_encoded), and (3) a one-hot representation of that position (output_unencoded). The design supports both LSB- and MSB-first priority selection."}
