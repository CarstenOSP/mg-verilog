This module identifies the highest-priority set bit in an input vector (with optional LSB-first priority), then signals if any bit is set, provides a binary index of the chosen bit, and offers a one-hot representation of that position. Internally, it processes the input through multiple hierarchy levels (if needed), consolidates partial decisions at each stage, and outputs valid, encoded, and one-hot signals to indicate which bit is the highest priority set bit.
