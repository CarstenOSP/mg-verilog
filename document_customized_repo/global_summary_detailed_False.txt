Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input areset,
	input bump_left,
	input bump_right,
	output walk_left,
	output walk_right
);
	parameter WL=0, WR=1;
	reg state;
	reg next;
    
    always_comb begin
		case (state)
			WL: next = bump_left ? WR : WL;
			WR: next = bump_right ? WL: WR;
		endcase
    end
    
    always @(posedge clk, posedge areset) begin
		if (areset) state <= WL;
        else state <= next;
	end
		
	assign walk_left = (state==WL);
	assign walk_right = (state==WR);

	
endmodule
Answer:  This module implements a state machine that alternates between two states based on the bump_left and bump_right inputs, and assigns walk_left and walk_right outputs accordingly.

Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input load,
	input [1:0] ena,
	input [99:0] data,
	output reg [99:0] q);
	
	
	always @(posedge clk) begin
		if (load)

		else if (ena == 2'h1)
			q <= {q[0], q[99:1]};
		else if (ena == 2'h2)
			q <= {q[98:0], q[99]};
	end
endmodule
Answer:  This module loads data into the output register q when the load input is asserted, and shifts the data in q one bit to the left or right when the ena input is asserted.

Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module
(
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input predict_valid,
    input predict_taken,
    output logic [31:0] predict_history,
    
    input train_mispredicted,
    input train_taken,
    input [31:0] train_history
);
    always@(posedge clk, posedge areset)
		if (areset) begin
			predict_history = 0;
        end	else begin
			if (train_mispredicted)
				predict_history <= {train_history, train_taken};
			else if (predict_valid)
				predict_history <= {predict_history, predict_taken};
		end
endmodule
Answer: This module updates the predict_history based on the train_mispredicted, train_taken, and train_history signals, or the predict_taken signal if predict_valid is asserted.

);
	
	always_comb 
		for (int i=0;i<$bits(out);i++)
			out[i] = in[$bits(out)-i-1];
	
endmodule
Answer:  This module reverses the order of the bits in the input and stores the result in the output.
```

Here are the summaries of the code blocks to be explained:
This section calculates how many hierarchical stages are needed for encoding, always ensuring at least one. It then finds and stores the power-of-two size that exceeds or equals the original width, and pads the input bits with zeros to match that size. Arrays are declared to hold “valid” signals and partial encoding results for each stage. A generate loop then inspects each pair of padded input bits to determine whether at least one bit in the pair is active, marking those pairs as valid for further processing in the subsequent encoding levels.
This block first determines how each pair of bits contributes to the initial encoded output based on whether the least significant bit has priority. When least significant bits take priority, the encoded bit is derived from the least significant side of the pair; otherwise, the more significant side is used. After establishing this initial encoding, a multi-level loop progressively combines pairs of signals from the prior stage into single valid outputs for the next stage. At each compression level, it merges the “valid” signals and then applies the selected priority scheme to prepare intermediate encoding results, continuing until all hierarchy levels are processed.

This final line concludes the module definition. It does not introduce any additional logic or outputs; instead, it simply signifies the end of the priority encoder module, ensuring that all preceding declarations and generated structures are fully enclosed within the design.
