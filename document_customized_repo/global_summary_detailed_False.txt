Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input areset,
	input bump_left,
	input bump_right,
	output walk_left,
	output walk_right
);
	parameter WL=0, WR=1;
	reg state;
	reg next;
    
    always_comb begin
		case (state)
			WL: next = bump_left ? WR : WL;
			WR: next = bump_right ? WL: WR;
		endcase
    end
    
    always @(posedge clk, posedge areset) begin
		if (areset) state <= WL;
        else state <= next;
	end
		
	assign walk_left = (state==WL);
	assign walk_right = (state==WR);

	
endmodule
Answer:  This module implements a state machine that alternates between two states based on the bump_left and bump_right inputs, and assigns walk_left and walk_right outputs accordingly.

Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input load,
	input [1:0] ena,
	input [99:0] data,
	output reg [99:0] q);
	
	
	always @(posedge clk) begin
		if (load)
			q <= data;
		else if (ena == 2'h1)
			q <= {q[0], q[99:1]};
		else if (ena == 2'h2)
			q <= {q[98:0], q[99]};
	end
endmodule
Answer:  This module loads data into the output register q when the load input is asserted, and shifts the data in q one bit to the left or right when the ena input is asserted.

	assign out_any = in | in[99:1];
	assign out_different = in^{in[0], in[99:1]};
	
endmodule
Answer:  This module takes in a 100-bit input and assigns three outputs based on the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR of the input and its 99 least significant bits.

Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module
(
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input predict_valid,
    input predict_taken,
    output logic [31:0] predict_history,
    
    input train_mispredicted,
    input train_taken,
    input [31:0] train_history
);
    always@(posedge clk, posedge areset)
		if (areset) begin
			predict_history = 0;
        end	else begin
			if (train_mispredicted)
				predict_history <= {train_history, train_taken};
			else if (predict_valid)
				predict_history <= {predict_history, predict_taken};
		end
endmodule
Answer: This module updates the predict_history based on the train_mispredicted, train_taken, and train_history signals, or the predict_taken signal if predict_valid is asserted.

Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module (
	input a,
	input b,
	input c,
	input d,
	output out_sop,
	output out_pos
);
	
	wire pos0, pos1;
	assign out_sop = c&d | ~a&~b&c;

	assign pos1 = c & (~b|d)&(~a|d);
	
	assign out_pos = (pos0 == pos1) ? pos0 : 1'bx;

Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input resetn,
	input [1:0] byteena,
	input [15:0] d,
	output reg [15:0] q);

				q[7:0] <= d[7:0];
			if (byteena[1])
				q[15:8] <= d[15:8];
		end
	end
	
endmodule
Answer:  This module is a synchronous register that loads data into the output q based on the byteena and d inputs when the clock signal is high.

			A: next = j ? B : A;
			B: next = k ? A : B;
		endcase
    end

		if (areset) state <= A;
        else state <= next;
	end
		
	assign out = (state==B);

	
endmodule
Answer:  This module implements a two-state finite state machine with inputs j and k, and output out.

Question: Explain the high-level functionality of the Verilog module.
module top_module (

	output reg [99:0] out
);
	
	always_comb 
		for (int i=0;i<$bits(out);i++)
			out[i] = in[$bits(out)-i-1];
	
endmodule
Answer:  This module reverses the order of the bits in the input and stores the result in the output.
```

Here are the summaries of the code blocks to be explained:
This block first figures out how many stages the priority encoder needs based on the input width. It then computes the next power-of-two size to cover all input bits and pads the original input to match that size. Arrays are declared to track, at each stage, which groups of bits contain at least one “1” (the valid signals) and how those valid signals map to partial one-hot encodings. Finally, it initializes the first stage by dividing the padded input

This block finalizes the multi-level selection process and produces the output signals. At each stage, it examines a pair of previously computed valid bits to decide which half contains a set bit and then selects the corresponding portion of the partial encoding. It also prefixes an additional bit to signify which half was chosen, thereby incrementally extending the partial encoded result. Finally, once all levels have been processed, the module outputs three signals: a single valid bit indicating that at least one input was set, a binary-encoded index pinpointing the highest-priority set bit, and a one-hot representation of that index.
This concludes the Verilog module definition, marking the end of all logic and parameter declarations for the priority encoder.
